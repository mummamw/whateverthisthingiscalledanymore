# Devoo
-Database: MySQL Instance

Milestones:

  -Write scripts to initialize database to store information on users and other app features.
  
  -Write service layer to provide application logic for things such as matching up people, storing and retrieving information,      sending and recieving messages, ect (this service layer will be exposed through JSON formatted services that will allow both     the IOS application as well as an web application to communicate with the database)
  
  -Create fake data and testing scripts to test the backend logic and storage abilities, to ensure the services are performing as     expected.
  
  -Create simple IOS application that succesfully comunicates with service layer and is able to send and recieve information.
  
  -Build out front end components of IOS application to create attractive user interface based upon prior design work
  
  -Get ready to release Devoo 1.0.0!
